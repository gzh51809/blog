Firstly, thanks for your interview.and it's my pleasure to have this opportunity to compete for this post of Front-End Software Engineer.

My Chinese Name is Chen Haoli, I've graduated from China Three Gorges University In June 2016, and my major is Automation, which is mainly learning hardware and software. In addition, I have been studing design since I was 14 years old, So, after graduation, I naturally become a front-end engineer, which is combining programming and design.

Next, please allow me to introduce my first job which was in an electric business company called SKG, I was responsible for SKG's official website, SKG WeChat public number, and SKG core office APP. In this work experience, the main technology of our Team includes: JQuery, BootStrap, AngularJS1, Ionic, Cordova, Gulp, Node and MySQL.what's more, through self-study, I introduced many technology to my team, such as Vue, Webpack, ES6 and Weex.

Starting from February this year, I came to Shanghai to help a friend to do his startup projects —— an open source ERP based in Domain-Driven Design. which is also the most complex project I have done. the technical stack includes: TypeScript、Vue、Webpack and mocha.

Then, I would like to summarize my personal characteristics.first,I'm very interested in learning new things. At the university, I often got professional first by self learning, After work, my technology level has been significantly improved by a lot of self-learning. Second, I really like to share, and I used to have a lot of sharing experience, so I am very looking forward to working in a team with substantial technical atmosphere.In another ,I also have some interests, such as literature、music、riding、calligraphy and photography.

Finally, summarize in one sentence, I am a front-end engineer who is full of passion and has some design basics. With my good technical foundation and enough enthusiasm and learning ability, I feel I can do some positive contributions to eBay in the future.

that's all. thanks.

Now, pleae allow me to introduce the projects I have done. 

Firstly, SKG WeChat public number, the technical stack of this project include JQuery、eCharts、SQLite etc. the main requirement is to allow users to register and manage the products they have purchased.

Secondly, SKG knowledge, which used AngularJS1，is located similar to Baidu Baike, and including all the SKG product details. The difficulty of this project are the analysis, processing and display of the data.

thirdly, SKG official website, which used JQuery and BootStrap. In this project, part of the module using a responsive layout, at the same time, I used the native js to write all the components. Such as drop down box、pop-up modal and automatic fixed navbar.

fourthly, SKG Work APP，a functional rich business management App. This project has cost our team for half a year，and its technology stack contains AngularJS1、Ionic、cordova and gulp. In this project, I participated in the technical selection, and completed the UI design for all pages, at the same time, I developed a detailed code specification. In the final of the project coding, The number of js files has reached more than 100. so, I also spent a lot of time to use gulp and node to complete the entire project automation build.

In SKG, I also completed the SKG video center, and a simple backstage management project based on Node and MySQL.

fifthly, DDDML, an open source ERP based in Domain-Driven Design. which is also the most complex project I have done. I chose the technical stack as follows: TypeScript、Vue、Webpack and mocha. this project is very demanding on object-oriented programming、data structure and certain algorithm; And I have made a high degree of abstraction for routes、web components, domain models, and view models.

In addition,I also have a lot of open source project experience. 

At present，I am a contributor for this projects: the ES6 tutorial of Ruan Yifeng、You-dont-need-JQuery and weex. 

I have also submitted issues to many well-known projects, such as typescript、element-UI、typings、stylus、iview、vue-router. 

moreover,I also have my own open source projects, such as time processing plugin “chatime” base on ES6 and rollup、a scaffolding tool “dli” base on nodejs 、 a simple and commonly used style library “light-stylus”、A tiny browser-side CommonJS module loader “alone.js”、a gulp-based which tests the async and sync performance of the node.js、A Vue 2.0 UI component library “ISUI” and a framework mixed with characteristics of vue and react. some of these projects are still under construction.
